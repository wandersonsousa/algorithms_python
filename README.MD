# Banker Algorithm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

## Features

- Data structures for algorithm can be passed by file or terminal

## Tech

the project uses only python and its built-in libraries

## Installation

Clone or download the project respository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wandersonsousa/banker_algorithm_python.git
```

Run index.py 

```sh
python index.py
```
[for file configuration, just change configuracao.py file]

## TODO
- I would like to add a GUI to the project

## Development
